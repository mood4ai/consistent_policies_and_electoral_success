Project scope:

Test the hypothesis that consistant ideological convitions of political parties have positive impact on their popularity and showcase it using an animated chart.
(Project-Notion-File: https://www.notion.so/consistancy-of-a-political-conviction-always-pays-off-Or-does-it-41340df0486b419f89c82d75ac3867bf)

Methodology:

  -	Preprocessing data of the Manifesto Project https://manifesto-project.wzb.eu/  in order to be able to show:
    o	The difference of a parties election result between two consecutive elections
    o	Absolute change of the importance of the topics, representing the change of policy
    
  -	Considering only parties, that were tracked for 18 or more years by the Manifesto Project
  
  - Since the focus of this project was to explore Data Science techniques and was by no means a Political Science study, only a few topics where chosen:
    o	Foreign Special Relationship
    o	Military
    o	Internationalism
    o	Constitutionalism
    o	Decentralisation
    o	Free Market
    o	Protectionism
    o	Walfare State
    o	Education Expansion
    o	National Way of Life
    o	Traditional Morality
    o	Multiculuralism
    o	Labour Groups

- The idea was to see, if a change of policy would lead to a positive or negative party performance between two elections and to cumulate those values over period of 18 consecutive elections.
